# Frontend Design

Create distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics. Implement real working code with exceptional attention to aesthetic details and creative choices.

## Design Thinking

Before coding, understand the context and commit to a BOLD aesthetic direction:

- **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?
- **Tone**: Pick an extreme—brutally minimal, maximalist chaos, retro-futuristic, organic/natural, luxury/refined, playful/toy-like, editorial/magazine, brutalist/raw, art deco/geometric, soft/pastel, industrial/utilitarian
- **Constraints**: Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility)
- **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE? What's the one thing someone will remember?

**CRITICAL**: Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision. Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work—the key is intentionality, not intensity.

## Implementation Requirements

Produce working code (HTML/CSS/JS, React, Vue, etc.) that is:

- Production-grade and functional
- Visually striking and memorable
- Cohesive with a clear aesthetic point-of-view
- Meticulously refined in every detail

## Aesthetic Guidelines

### Typography

Choose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting. Avoid generic fonts like Arial, Inter, Roboto. See [references/typography.md](references/typography.md) for distinctive font pairings.

### Color & Theme

Commit to a cohesive aesthetic. Use CSS variables for consistency. Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid, evenly-distributed palettes.

### Motion

Focus on high-impact moments: one well-orchestrated page load with staggered reveals creates more delight than scattered micro-interactions.

- CSS-only solutions for HTML
- Motion library for React when available
- Use `animation-delay` for staggered reveals
- Scroll-triggering and hover states that surprise

### Spatial Composition

- Unexpected layouts
- Asymmetry and overlap
- Diagonal flow
- Grid-breaking elements
- Generous negative space OR controlled density

### Backgrounds & Visual Details

Create atmosphere and depth:

- Gradient meshes, noise textures, geometric patterns
- Layered transparencies, dramatic shadows
- Decorative borders, custom cursors, grain overlays

## Anti-Patterns (NEVER Use)

- Overused fonts: Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts
- Clichéd color schemes: purple gradients on white
- Predictable layouts and component patterns
- Cookie-cutter design lacking context-specific character

## Complexity Matching

Match implementation complexity to the aesthetic vision:

- **Maximalist designs**: Elaborate code with extensive animations and effects
- **Minimalist designs**: Restraint, precision, careful attention to spacing, typography, and subtle details

See [references/aesthetic-examples.md](references/aesthetic-examples.md) for implementation patterns.
